    <p>
    A BlueJeans meeting is a collaboration session of 2 or more participants joining a virtual meeting-room in the cloud.
	</p>
	<p>
    The first person to join is put into a waiting-room until other participant(s) join.  When the meeting starts, all participants will be connected over video & audio.
	</p>
	
	<p>    
    There are two types of Meeting Rooms
	<ul>
	<li>Scheduled – A room created for a specific date and time.  It is assigned a randomized and unique numeric ID by BlueJeans.
	</li>
	<li>Personal – Every user is given a personal meeting room with a customized Meeting Identifier.  People typically use their mobile phone number as their Meeting ID.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<?p>
	
	<p>    
    The room may be protected by an access code, and may assigned a moderator passcode allowing designated user(s) greater privileges to help organize meetings.
